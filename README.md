# Simon REDUX

When I was a young lad, there was a game machine at the Little Caesar's pizza in the strip mall near Big Lots. You paid a quarter, and the machine would light up a sequence of colored buttons. If you repeated the sequence, the machine would respond with a longer one. At a certain point your successes started to reward you with a large soda, an order of bread sticks, or even a free pizza. Never in my life since have I been so easily rewarded for my talents. 

This game was made with Redux as a means of familiarizing myself with that framework.
